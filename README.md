# fresh-grow-organic-shop

I want you to develop a website for a Shop that sells organic agricultural products. The name of the shop is Fresh Grow, they sell a variety of items inclusive of fertilizers, insecticides, bird repellants etc. Now is How I want it to be, I want the theme colors to be green, yellow, brown, and grey(light). The should be a locked header item with a Home, Services, About and Contact US buttons. The Products should have a drop down that's activated by the mouse hover that with options for Our Products and Our Services. The About us option should have the following dropdown options, which are, Who are we, Mission & Vision, Core Values, CSR, Achievements and Milestones, Accreditations. The Home page should have a hero section which will include an image slider with 2 image options that span across the page. There should be a welcome section, a few photos and at least 4 products with the option of see more. The Products page should have a section for products, and a section for services and a section for customer reviews. You should use Tailwind CSS and font Awesome for all the icons used on the website. Social media links should be on the footer alongside the T&Cs and the header links.
